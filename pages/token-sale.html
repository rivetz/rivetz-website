<div class="position-paper-content">
  <section>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to outline a path forward for utility tokens based on the current jumbled state of case law created by the old SEC. Regulation by Enforcement is a very blunt model especially when the Agency has the goal of execution vs better road signs.</p>
    
    <p>But it is what we have and hoping it is different is not a strategy to move forward.</p>
    
    <p>The recent dismissal of the Dragon Chain cases while great for Dragon Chain and the founders, it does not help others execute as it created no new case law. It does signal that the SEC and the Task Force are open to a new approach.</p>
    
    <p>After 5 years of arguing as an executive and not a lawyer the case law of Howey, I believe there is a path ahead today and we are prepared to both execute on it and fight for it.</p>

    <h2>Our Position</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Utility tokens should be sold today to USA consumers using an investment contract and REG CF to provide the path for appropriate disclosure from the manufacturer of the token providing clear contract language and clear disclosure and assuring that all public promotion and statements are captured and disclosed to USA buyers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Payments for tokens will be made to the Reg CF platform escrow account and at the completion of the sale period established in the contract the Platform custodian will deliver the tokens according to the contract.</p>
    
    <p>All sales from inventory by the token creation company will be executed as sales by investment contract.</p>
    
    <p>Exchanges will list token and maintain listings of tokens as long as all sales from the smart contract have attached to the transaction the Investment contract identifier. If a company distributes tokens from the smart contract without a clear contract then tokens are subject to being removed from the exchange.</p>
    
    <p>Buyers of tokens may either transfer the tokens for use or for secondary sale without restriction.</p>
    
    <p>Companies should not be promoters or fund promoters or analysts of tokens for investment. Exchanges and third parties who do not have access to non-material information may promote tokens as they see fit. Companies will follow the material information disclosure models for Reg CF and for larger organizations Reg A and more disclosure based on the value of tokens that are in commercial distribution. Tokens held by the company are inventory until sold and should be valued at the cost to manufacture them.</p>

    <h2>Case Law</h2>
    
    <p>The SEC has systematically built a stack of case law that will prevent utility companies from doing business in the USA. All of this case law is captured in the Rivetz ruling that the sale of the token was done by investment contract. It is easier to declare initial sales investment contracts and show how this can execute and rely on the fact that ongoing transfer is not transfer of a security according to Ripple.</p>
    
    <h3>Ripple Defines</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Secondary sales of tokens are not the sale of security.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Rivetz Defines</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Rivetz provides the minimum requirements for a token sale offering to be an investment contract.</li>
      <li>Whitepaper defining the operational characteristics of the token and the general ecosystem definition</li>
      <li>Sales contract that defines the token delivered and its function, warrantees, support etc.</li>
      <li>Description of the team being relied on to operate and develop the token and applications and promote the token for third party use.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>LBRY Defines</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Promotion of the token to investment clubs by the company is an investment contract</li>
      <li>Purchasing with the intent to use the token does not trump the fact that the token can be transferred and transfer of a token creates an investment contract</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>SG and Edwards Define</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>A profit may be based on "capital appreciation of the original investment"); Edwards</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In my opinion, despite the recent political accommodation for meme coins, the SEC is not going to allow the companies to create, support, operate or use secondary market trading to either make or influence the market. If the company is also a market maker then the product being sold might itself must be a security. The case law in crypto is extensive on this but is built on a foundation of promotional promises made by Merrill Lynch creating a market for CDs in Gary Plastic and SG creating promotional promises for a market for their created tokens in the SG case before tokens were a concept.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Kik was determined primarily to be an investment contract due to the promises made to create, operate and use a secondary market.</li>
      <li>Telegram promised to support the market price and secure secondary market support on exchanges.</li>
      <li>SG promised to create a market for their internal game token</li>
      <li>Merrill Lynch agreed to create and support a market for the trading of CD's</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For the companies supporting a strategy of selling tokens using investment contracts and REG CF: The selling company should leave all secondary market models to others and only sell tokens into the market from inventory using an investment contract. This is an area that can work today and is ripe for refinement by SEC in future rule making or guidance or new laws from Congress.</p>

    <h2>Foreign Sales</h2>
    
    <p>Direct sales from a foreign subsidiary to a foreign customer are not governed by a USA defined investment contract. Companies using Reg CF to sell tokens to USA customers should use a USA-only subsidiary and keep the funds from USA sales to support USA development, sales, marketing and G&A expenses. Foreign sales by a sister subsidiary could be used either by the foreign sub or transferred to the sister company or parent.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>Utility tokens are the backbone for future software and service business models. The Utility token market has been disrupted by the SEC and it appears there is a chance for those roadblocks to be removed. The goal is for industry to have a viable model today and not have to wait for congressional changes or take undue risk.</p>
    
    <p>The risks Rivetz took were reasonable at the time; the crushing of a technology by the US government was not expected. The approach contemplated using the construct of an investment contract, REG CF as a regulatory framework, and the Ruling in the Ripple case that tokens transferred between third parties are not securities transactions.</p>
