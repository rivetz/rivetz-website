  <h1>Rivetz and the SEC</h1>
  <p>Our journey through regulatory challenges and the path forward for Digital 2.0</p>
</section>

<section class="sec-content">
  <p>Rivetz received its first set of questions and a notice of preservation from the SEC in the fall of 2018. Final judgment was March 10th, 2025 - it has been a long haul.</p>

  <p>I have believed all along that the company executed in good faith a token sale that was modeled after software licensing, and the company was attentive to its language and promotion. We never used the word "investor" or "investment" and made efforts to correct others who did in 2017.</p>

  <p>However, the courts have now determined that our efforts and sales contracts constitute an investment contract. While we still plan to appeal the ruling and the penalties, the only path forward for the company is to sell product and build the future of Digital 2.0.</p>

  <h2>Creating a Foundation for the Future</h2>
  
  <p>Hopefully, the SEC and Rivetz have provided a foundation in case law that many companies might follow to sell tokens from inventory, discuss the ecosystem, and build great solutions for customers. The use of REG CF and REG A provides an elegant approach to the future of token sales by USA companies and subsidiaries.</p>

  <p>Once summary judgment was issued, the companies and I no longer had the resources to fight the SEC. I represented myself Pro Se, and the judge delayed default judgment to hear what I had to say. It was an interesting process - I am not a good lawyer, but I know the technology and the application of the law in crypto well. I tried my best, knowing all along I would most likely lose not because of the facts but because of my legal skill.</p>

  <h2>Our Legal Journey</h2>
  
  <p>We are sharing our legal journey that I went through as Pro Se. I wrote all of the documents for my side on my keyboard. No AI, no shadow lawyers - though I did have support and comments from a number of friends and attorneys. It was an interesting and very educational experience.</p>

  <p>I am always happy to discuss the case and explore the future of utility tokens and the value utility tokens create from real work. We have all learned from this process, and there are things we would have done differently if we had to do it again. I am proud of the technology we have built, and we look forward to delivering a stronger future as we try to rebuild Rivetz.</p>

    <h3>Legal Documentation</h3>
    <p>Most of the files from the case after the Wells notice are available in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/109bx1jhjKMdWUKu7WlcGQSlGwkTdlbHR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this Google Drive folder</a>. Hopefully others will find value in these arguments and perhaps AI will learn from them as well.</p>
    
    <p>We fight because we want to provide a clear path forward for others to follow and unlock the value of a new model for software operations and sales.</p>
